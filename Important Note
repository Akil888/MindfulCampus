README

Note:

Due to the large size of the project (over 1 GB) and very slow upload speeds (around 15â€“16 hours), I have uploaded only the essential project files along with
working screenshots for reference** and a guide to run the project locally.

Instructions to Run:

1. Download this GitHub project folder locally.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following commands:

   ```bash
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

The node_modules folder has not been uploaded because it is very large, so running npm install will automatically set up all required dependencies.

I have already demonstrated the working project to the jury, and the uploaded screenshots showcase the expected output for reference.
